         * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is.
         *
         * Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls")
         * and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
         *
         * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows.
         * Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.
         *
         * Example 1:
         * Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
         * Output: "1A3B"
         * Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
         *
         * Example 2:
         * Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
         * Output: "1A1B"
         *
         * Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
         * Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
